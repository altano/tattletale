Introduction
============

A script that takes another script as a command line argument, runs that
script, and logs detailed runtime information to ~/.tattletale_history.

Examples
========

./tattletale ls -al
./tattletale ~/some/script

This is can be useful for testing cron jobs that aren't doing what you'd 
like them to do.  For example, let's say you have a cronjob specified as:

0 5 * * * /var/www/example.com/current/script/cron/somescript.rb

To enable tattletale logging, change this line to:

0 5 * * * /usr/local/bin/tattletale.rb /var/www/example.com/current/script/cron/somescript.rb

Then, you can find the logs of runtime information in the .tattletale_history
directory in the home directory of the user who owns the crontab.
